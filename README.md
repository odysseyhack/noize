# Data-B : CoCreating and sharing validated data during a disaster
 
Add Final description of the hackathon project

## Folder  Contents
### Data-B
Th√¨s folder contains all code running on the back end. It is a simple Front end for the Emergency departement which shows 
three simple guidelines. Estimated human resources in the building, eventually a local heatmap with temperature values from
all sensors in the facility and the 3D reconstruction

### People
In this directory are stored all files related to the estimation of human resources present in the building. 
Please note that the worst case scenario has been studied and solved. Usually the information provided by a badge system can be 
directly used to get the number of people in the building. Here we have analyzed the situation in which the Building has
only entry and exit cameras.

### Demo
This directory contains the final demos that have been developed during the hackathon. Refer to the Readme for further information
