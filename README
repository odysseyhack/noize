This folder contains the demos realized during the hackathon.

	people_detect: Shows the result of the human resource estimation process using Convolutional Neural Network taking advantage of the opencv and Yolo libraries. As we can see the algorithm tracks all persons in the scene. 
	This is the worst case scenario in which the IoT infrastructure of the facility is not equipped with a badge system. A typical application of the procedure would be: Estimate number people from 8:00 to current datetime

	Slam: This file shows a proof of concept of the mapping procedure. It is a positive answer to the question: Can we really 3D map whichever building we want using a robot equipped with a depth sensor (stereocamera or 3D Lidar technology) or manually using a Kinect sensor?

	git_populate: A Nice visualization of the word done during the hackathon. This animation shows all commits done by the contributors
