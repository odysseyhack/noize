## People Detection

![Alt text](demo_people.png?raw=true "Human Resource Estimation")

Shows the result of the human resource estimation process using Convolutional Neural Network taking advantage of the opencv and Yolo libraries. As we can see the algorithm tracks all persons in the scene. 

This is the worst case scenario in which the IoT infrastructure of the facility is not equipped with a badge system. A typical application of the procedure would be: Estimate number people from 8:00 to current datetime

## Slam and 3D reconstruction

![Alt text](demo_slam.png?raw=true "3D localization and mapping")

This file shows a proof of concept of the localization and mapping procedure. It is a positive answer to the question: Can we really 3D map whichever building we want using a robot equipped with a depth sensor (stereocamera or 3D Lidar technology) or manually using a Kinect sensor? And once we have the map, is it possible to localize the firefighter in the building only using a depth sensor?
